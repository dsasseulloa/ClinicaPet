## JQuery Datatables Editor - Alternative to the official one

Add capabilities to add, edit and delete rows in your datatables through the use of modals.

Inline editing is not supported (so far).

### Basic usage

Include in the project the libraries jQuery, jquery.dataTables, dataTables.buttons, dataTables.select.

Define a DataTable as usual. 

Pass to the DataTable constructor at least the following arguments: `dom`, `select`, `buttons`, `altEditor: true` (see the examples).


### Examples

There are some examples in the folder `example`, for different use cases:

* a DataTable populated and maintained via Javascript, (no AJAX, no databases), with data organized in rows;

* a DataTable populated and maintained via Javascript, (no AJAX, no databases), with data organized in objects;

* a DataTable populated via AJAX, to be used in connection with a databases, with data organized in objects.

Examples can be browsed at https://luca-vercelli.github.io/DataTable-AltEditor .

### AJAX setup

The datatable accepts the following callback functions as arguments:

    onAddRow(datatable, rowdata, success, error)
    onEditRow(datatable, rowdata, success, error)
    onDeleteRow(datatable, rowdata, success, error)

In the most common case, these function should call `$.ajax` as expected by the webservice.
The two functions `success` and `error` should be passed as arguments to `$.ajax`.

Webservice **must** return the modified row in JSON format, because the `success()` function expects this.
Otherwise you have to write your own `success()` callback (e.g. refreshing the whole table). 

### Row key

There is no default key in the table.
Inside your callback functions, probably you will need a row key to build URL's, in that case you can get them from the `rowdata` parameter.

### Column id

Please always keep in mind that DataTable framework allows two different kinds of "rows": Arrays and Objects.
In first case columns are indexed through integers; in second case columns are indexed by their attribute name.
Usually JSON's use the Object approach, but we cannot be sure.

### Column modifiers, and validation

Following column options are supported.

| Column option          | Accepted values                         | Description                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|    `type`     | `"text" \| "select" \| "hidden" \| ...`   |   Type of HTML input to be shown. The value `readonly` is accepted for backward compatibility, but deprecated. |
|    `readonly` | `true \| false`   |   Add `readonly` HTML attribute |
|    `disabled` | `true \| false`   |   Add `disabled` HTML attribute |
|    `hoverMsg` | `"some msg"`      |   The message will appear as a tooltip over the input field.     |
|    `unique`   | `true \| false`   |   Ensure that no two rows have the same value. The check is performed client side, not server side. Set HTML `"data-unique"` attribute. (Probably there's some issue with this). |
|   `uniqueMsg` | `"some msg"`      |   An error message that is displayed when the unique constraint is not respected. Set HTML `"data-uniqueMsg"` attribute. |
|    `special`  | `"any string"`    |   Set HTML `"data-special"` attribute (don't know what's that needed for). |
| | |
| **Options for columns with type `"text"`:**                |                                   | |
|    `pattern` | `r.e.`             |   The typed text will be matched against given regular expression, before submit. |
|    `msg`     | `"some msg"`       |   An error message that is displayed in case pattern is not matched. Set HTML `"data-errorMsg"` attribute. |
|  `maxLength` | `integer`          |   Set HTML `"maxlength"` attribute. |
| `datepicker` | `{}`               |   Enable a datepicker component. jQuery-UI plugin must be linked. More datepicker configuration options may be passed within the object. |
| `datetimepicker` | `{}`               |   Enable a datetimepicker component. jQuery datetimepicker plugin must be linked. More datetimepicker configuration options may be passed within the object. |
| | |
| **Options for columns with type `"select"`:**                |                                   | |
|    `options` | `["a", "b", "c"]`  or `{"a":"A", "b":"B", "c":"C"}` |   The options that shall be presented. |
|    `select2` | `{}`               |   Enable a select2 component. Select2 jQuery plugin must be linked. More select2 configuration options may be passed within the object. |
|   `multiple` | `true \| false`    |   Set HTML `"multiple"` attribute. |
